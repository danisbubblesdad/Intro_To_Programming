What does the following error message tell you?

NameError: undefined local variable or method `shoes' for main:Object
  from (irb):3
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'



=============

The method/variable shoes is not defined in the current scope. The first place I would check would be inside of any do/end blocks. It could be a spelling issue too!
