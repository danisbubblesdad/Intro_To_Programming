Look at the following programs...

x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x
and...

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x
What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?

=============


Case 1:

x = 3


Case 2:

Error because x is out of scope. It is a local variable to the .times loop.
