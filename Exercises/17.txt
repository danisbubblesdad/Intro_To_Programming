What will the following program output?

hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}

if hash1 == hash2
  puts "These hashes are the same!"
else
  puts "These hashes are not the same!"
end

===================

A: For hashes, the ordering does not matter. Since all of the key and corresponding values are the same, the program will puts "These hashes are the same!".
